# Build binary and make sure there is at least an empty key file.
#  This is useful for GCP App Engine custom runtime builds, because
#  you cannot use multiline variables in their app.yaml, so you have to
#  build the key into the container and then tell it where it is
#  by setting OAUTH2_PROXY_JWT_KEY_FILE=/etc/ssl/private/jwt_signing_key.pem
#  in app.yaml instead.
